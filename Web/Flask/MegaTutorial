Working through the mega tutorial
#################################

As an introduction to setting up a Flask application for my ACC website, I
decided to work through the `Flask Mega Tutorial
<http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>`_
, both as a quick review of Flask, and to check to see how much has changed
since this tutorial was put together.

The tutorial is an 18-part series that builds a blog application with several
interesting features worthy of study.

**********************
Starting a new project
**********************

All Python development projects should start off in a :term:`virtual
environment`. Here is how we set one up:

..  code-block:: test
    
    virtualenv _venv

The choice of name was dictated by my Sphinx application used to build my tech
note series. The code will be in a folder with the documentation, and using the
leading underscore keeps my system happy.
