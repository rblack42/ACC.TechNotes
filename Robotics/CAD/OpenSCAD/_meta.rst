title = OpenSCAD: Scriptable CAD

description = 

Unlike many other CAD packages, this one is not a GUI based system, although it
does have a GUI interface for creating scripts and trying things out. At its
heart, you describe the object you are trying to build, and the program reads
your description and geenrates a visual image of that object. You can create
scripts with any text editor, and run the system from the command line. It
feels very much like PovRay_.
