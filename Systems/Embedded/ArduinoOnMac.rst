Arduino on the Mac
##################

..  include::   /references.inc

We can install the standard Arduino development tools on the Mac to build
projects in both ``C`` and assembly language. 

..  note::

    The installation here should be compatible with the setup I use in a
    :term:`virtual machine` on my Mac as well.  (see
    :doc:`../../Programming/Languages/C/Arduino/ArduinoOnUbuntu`
