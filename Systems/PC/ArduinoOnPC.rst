Arduino on the PC
#################

We can install the standard Arduino development tools on a PC to build
projects in both ``C`` and assembly language. 

..  note::
    
    In order to keep the programs configured so they work on any platform, you
will need to create a few directories that look like those found on Linux and
Mac systems. If you do not need that compatibility, feel free to load things as
you wish. The configuration shown here has been battle tested by my students!
