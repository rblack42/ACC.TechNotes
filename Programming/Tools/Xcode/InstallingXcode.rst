Installing Xcode on Mac
#######################

In order to do any program development on the Mac, you need to install
:program:`Xcode` and the companion `Command line tools`. Both of these files
can be downloaded from the Apple Developer website (you will need a valid Apple
ID to log in):

* https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#

I downloaded two files:

* xcode_5.0.1.dmg (2GB)
* command_line_tools_os_x_mountain_lion_for_xcode__october_2013.dmg

Installing both of these must be done manually, but I will create a clone of
the image after this has been done. (see :doc:`/Systems/Mac/Cloning`)
