I teach classes in computer architecture and programming using machine
language. In those courses, we explore three different kinds of systems: the
modern Intel 64-bit processor found in most laptop and desktop machines, the
32-bit Arm processor found in many mobile devices like smart phones and
tablets, and small, 8-bit microcontrollers, typically used to control small
pieces of equipment. In this section, we will cover setting up the development
systems needed to program these processors, and examine a few applications of
those machines.
